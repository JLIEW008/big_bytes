# Big Bytes Challenge 2019
This repository includes our team's Jupyter Notebook and presentation slides for Cognizant's [Big Bytes Challenge](http://bigbytes.sg/).  
Note: The jupyter notebook posted here was submitted for the semi-finals. 

## Model
We utilised [Easy-SMT](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8295035)(Wu et al., 2018) (Easy Ensemble + SMOTE) to balance the minority-majority class difference, with XGBoost as the baseline model. We found that this technique aligns with our initial goal of maximising recall of fraud cases. However, upon more indepth analysis of credit card fraud and the corresponding cost of false positives, we decided to use a more balanced approach to minimise cost due to credit card fraud.
